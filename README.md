# Twitter-Feed-Analyzer
🐦 A Flask web app that fetches tweets using the Twitter API, performs sentiment analysis using VADER, and displays results with metrics and emojis. Styled with Bootstrap and animations, and stores data in MongoDB. Ideal for opinion mining and social media insights.  Let me know if you want a shorter tagline version too!
