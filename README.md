🐦 Twitter Feed Analyzer

Twitter Feed Analyzer is a full-stack web application that analyzes tweets from any Twitter user and detects the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner).

It displays detailed tweet metrics (likes, retweets, replies, quotes), sentiment labels, emojis, and saves the analyzed data to a MongoDB database — all through a stylish and animated UI built with Flask and Bootstrap.
